        <h1>Laughing through the walls</h1>

        <P> Lauging through the walls is what i would
            name it.Due to
            Noah's ability to find humor during the harsh realities of apartheid.
            Trevor noah used humor to survive of his painful experience growing up under apartheid.
            The challenges he encountered from poverty to <br>racism,made the person he is.Through out Born a
            Crime,Trevor shows that humor is not just a scape
            but a tool to cope,resisit and tranform trauma into strength and understanding.

        <h1>Exploring Abel's Paradoxal Desire</h1>
        <div class="quote">
            "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient
            women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'"
        </div>


        <p> Having spent three years in the scary times of war freedom wasn't just an idea .It was like that
            open sky for a trapped bird.It was the feeling of being safe and able to do what i wanted with out
            no one saing "no" it was one of the most important things I yearned for.The idea of some one wanting a free
            spirit only to imprsion them is a similar to how bigger from of
            <!-- war and unfair treatment starts. </P> -->
            <!-- <p> -->
            <br>
            I believe that behaviour steams from a deep insecurity,a need to control.Even druing peace time i
            see that the expectation for women to shoulder the domestic duties while also excelling
            professionaly.If women dream "too big" sometimes their partenrs even society try to dim their light.
            when partners say they love,the possesivness disguised as love-are the bars ready to keep her locked
            in as Abel did to patricia afraid to be them selves.<br>Abel,like many people today,is drawn to independent
            and strong woman,a contrast to the roles of society has historically assigned.But when he said putting her
            in cage it shows a basic misunderstanding of love and partnership.True connection thrives on mutual respect
            of eachother's
            compnay.
            <br>
            Today's gender role are shifiting.Women are being encoraged to chase careers and dream big.Yet,when
            their success shine traditional expectations,partenrens even society subtly try to hold them down.I
            see this in different conversations with friedns when a woman prioritize her career over a merriage
            or refuse to settle,she gets labeled as "too much".Love mixed with insecurity can become a cage
            rather than safe place.<br>True relationships however should be space of freedom not a control.Loving
            someone is accepting thier full self not shrinking them to fit to your comfortzone.Abel's desire to capture
            and contain
            what he admired in patricia reflects misunderstanding.Love should never be about ownership,it
            demands mutual respect and to let eachother fly not to hold each other's wing.
