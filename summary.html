            In Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood, comedian and television personality
            <br> Trevor Noah gives a heartfelt and funny recounting of his experiences growing up in South
            <br> Africa as an oppressed person. Stories of Noah’s life are interspersed with insights 
            <br>into South Africa’s culture, systems, and history. Noah was born in 1984 to a single mother,
            <br> Patricia, during the time of racial segregation known as apartheid. Patricia was a strong,
            <br> driven woman who paid little heed to the racist laws that oppressed her. Noah’s father,
            <br> Robert, agreed to give Patricia a child during a time when sexual relationships between 
            <br>black and white South Africans were illegal. Robert, a Swiss immigrant, never supported segregation 
            <br>and did what he could to undermine apartheid. Because it was dangerous for Patricia and Robert to be
            <br> seen with their mixed-race child, Noah recalls sometimes being momentarily abandoned by his parents in public settings.

        <p1>Dutch colonizers came to South Africa in the 1600s and used slave labor to run their farms on stolen 
            <br>land. The white South Africans called Afrikaners are descended from these colonizers. Black South Africans, 
            <br>from tribes including the Zulu, Xhosa, and Sotho tribes, were subjugated under apartheid law until the
            <br> mid-1990s. A third racial group emerged from the intermingling of the Black and white South Africans:
            <br> mixed-race or “colored.” Both during apartheid and after its dissolution, mixed-race South Africans 
            <br>were the most marginalized and disenfranchised people. Noah often felt defined by what he wasn’t:
            <br> not light enough to be labeled as white and not dark enough to be fully accepted into Black culture.
        </p1>

           Apartheid ended in 1994, but Noah’s struggles as a mixed-race child in South Africa continued. It was 
           <br>often hard for Noah to determine which groups would accept him. Patricia had always encouraged her son
           <br> to read and think independently; she valued education and made sure that her son spoke multiple languages.
           <br> Of the eleven official languages in South Africa, Noah could speak Zulu, Tsonga, English, and Afrikaans.
           <br> This skill allowed him to move among different racial and cultural groups at school. 
           <br>Though Noah felt out of place in many social settings, his ability to talk and empathize with many
           <br> different types of people served him well throughout his life. Even at a young age, Noah understood
           <br> that the bullying he experienced from his mixed-race peers was likely a result of the self-hatred all 
           <br>mixed-race South Africans had been taught. Noah was a mischievous child, but Patricia believed in tempering
           <br> her punishments with assurances to her son that she held him accountable because she loved him. Patricia 
           <br>knew that the world would not always be kind and generous to Noah, and she wanted to prepare him well.

         During his high school years, Noah acquired a small bootleg CD business from a friend. Noah soon found that he
         <br> could make more money working with his friend Sizwe, who was from the poorer, crowded Johannesburg township
         <br> called Alexandra—known to most residents as Alex. After graduation Noah moved to Alex to expand his profits, 
         <br>with Sizwe’s help. Sizwe recognized that Noah had talent as a live DJ, and the pair formed a performance 
         <br>group. Noah and his group sold bootleg and mixed CDs, dealt in stolen goods, performed at parties and concerts,
         <br> and did their best to avoid confrontations with local law enforcement. Noah was already familiar with the 
         <br>South African police. Patricia received no help from the local police when she tried to file charges against 
         <br>her abusive husband. Noah was arrested for shoplifting, on suspicion of carrying a weapon, and for driving an 
         <br>unregistered vehicle. One arrest kept Noah in jail for several days, and Patricia had to pay for his lawyer.
         <br> Despite his dealings with law enforcement, Noah could see his own privilege in comparison to many of his peers.
         <br> Patricia had worked hard to make sure her son had the ability to make a life for himself.

        The men in Noah’s life taught him little about how to interact with women. Robert was a distant but generally pleasant
        <br> presence. Patricia’s father, Temperance Noah, was an unpredictable figure. Later, Noah would learn that his 
        <br>grandfather had bipolar disorder and would often beat his wife, Frances. Patricia experienced abuse in her marriage
        <br> as well. Noah’s stepfather, Abel, became acquainted with Patricia and her young son during their many visits to the 
        <br>automotive shop where Abel worked on their run-down car. After Abel and Patricia married, he bought the shop. 
        <br>Patricia was forced to sell her home to keep the business running, and the family spent a stressful year living in 
        <br>the shop warehouse. Abel often came home drunk, and he began beating his wife. Once Abel had sons of his own, 
        <br>Noah’s half-brothers Andrew and Isaac, Abel’s hostility toward Patricia’s oldest son grew. When Patricia learned that
        <br> her violent husband had bought a gun, she helped Noah move out on his own. 
     </p1>
     <br>
     <br>
     <p1>
      One day, Noah received a phone call from Andrew with news that Abel, now estranged from his family, had come to 
      <br>Patricia’s new house and shot her in the head as she was shielding Andrew and Isaac. Miraculously, Patricia survived. 
      <br>Noah was able to cover her medical bills, and Patricia thanked God for protecting her and giving her
      <br> a son who could afford to help her.
