    <p1>In relation Abelâ€™s characteristics, to the society on gender roles and relationships gives the picture of taking
        <br> men as dominant  and women as submissive. Years ago most of the men used to prefer to marry women to control 
        <br>and let them not do any social or economic activities, just because they were jealous of them or their beliefs. 
        <br>In those times women were not allowed to participate in any activity apart from staying home, to take care of
        <br> the hasband  and the kid and to do the house chores. </p1>
    <br><br>
    <p1>These kinds of practices were leading women down since they had no chance to try on anything in the name of
        <br> fearing my husband.  These social, cultural and relationship beliefs are part of such practices that encourage poverty
        <br> and independent living which makes life harder than what is taught. Women being part of the society and family but not given 
        <br>a chance to show or learn some talents, brings the economic status down since an activity which was supposed to be worked for 
        <br>short periods of time and earn more sources, It's worked by specific persons over a long period of time and earning a little 
        <br>from their effort.  Taking women as weak humans pulls-down living status level since they are treated as nobodies due their independence.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>But in today's society most people strive for equal relationships whereby everyone can express freely.
    <br> This is helping in building personal skills especially to women since they are able to stand for 
    <br>their thoughts and bring them to live. Women are a big part of the world which is building the economic 
    <br>status of the world in a short period of time, in the presence of their participation in different activities and
    <br> self-show of confidence in collaborations. Women dependance is improving past thoughts. Building women is building the world heart. </p1>
